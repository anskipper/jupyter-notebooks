Mr. AbuAkel joined Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) full-time as a Research Engineer I in 2014.
During his time at GTRI, he contributed to over fifteen sponsored projects, three technical reports, two internal research and design (IRAD) projects, and a journal submission; managed or mentored five students; and earned a master's degree.
Through these experiences, Mr. AbuAkel has demonstrated his interpersonal skills and technical acumen across a variety of subjects within the domain of electrical engineering including system design, development, and testing.

Of those sponsored projects he contributed to, five could be described as key delivered products: a test bench for ALR-69A radar warning receivers; testing and validation for the Radio Frequency Interference Blanking Switch (RFIBS); an apparatus for characterizing the Slot Tunable Band Reject Filter (STBRF); software for automated testing; and threat engagement simulation software.
The remaining sponsored projects revolved around supporting sponsors in testing electromagnetic systems and writing technical reports on various systems.

Mr. AbuAkel started his career studying the interoperability between electromagnetic systems on a fighter jet platform.
This project introduced him to a variety of systems that GTRI works on.
He then designed and developed the radio frequency (RF) front-end of a radar warning receiver (RWR) on the RWR Operational Advancement and Readiness (ROAR) IRAD.
His front-end that was developed on this IRAD has been used on several GTRI projects.
The test bench design for the ALR-69A RWR that Mr. AbuAkel worked on has also been used on other designs across divisions to create more test assets.
Mr. AbuAkel has trained sponsors on using GTRI-developed tools and received praise from the sponsor on training for the STBRF characterization apparatus.

In addition to hardware products, Mr. AbuAkel has worked on software projects. 
He helped develop the Automated Test Framework (ATF), which can automate testing for hardware systems that use the military standard 1553 data bus.
The ATF has been used on other projects to speed up testing and alleviate some of the repetitive tasks of testing.

While working full-time at GTRI, Mr. AbuAkel pursued and completed a master's degree in electrical and computer engineering with a technical focus in electromagnetism and stochastic systems.
During his academic career, he mastered several topics in electrical and computer engineering.
He wrote computational electromagnetic solvers using both the finite element method and finite difference time domain method.
He developed software using optimization algorithms, such as the genetic algorithm and the hill climb algorithm, to optimize the design of antennas.
He designed, fabricated, tested, and characterized RF filters and couplers.
He studied the effects on radio waves propagating in earth and space environments.

Throughout his tenure at GTRI, Mr. AbuAkel has honed his interpersonal and managerial skills by working across labs while on GTRI-wide projects and mentoring co-op students within his lab.
Mr. AbuAkel has been integral to the success of each project he worked on.
His contributions were impactful, maintained positive customer relationships, and formed strong connections across labs within GTRI.
He is fully qualified for promotion to the rank of Research Engineer II.
